# Fire Simulation Lecture @ BUW

The structure of the lecture [Fire Simulation](https://cce.uni-wuppertal.de/en/teaching/fire-simulation/) taught at the University of Wuppertal is split into two parts. This is due to the fact that two groups of students with different extents visit this course.

**Fire Simulation I (FS I):** XYZ

**Fire Simulation II (FS II):** XYZ

The general 14 week schedule covers these topics:
