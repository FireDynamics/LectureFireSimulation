# CoBra Workshop

The CoBra workshop series is aimed at professional fire safety engineers. Its goal is to provide further training on the usage of high performance computing clusters and data analysis in the field of fire and smoke spread simulation. It builds on the [Fire Simulation](https://cce.uni-wuppertal.de/en/teaching/fire-simulation/) lecture, taught at the University of Wuppertal.

Each iteration of the workshop is distributed over two days. The training takes place in the afternoon of the first day and in the morning of the following day.

**Workshop I, Introduction to High Performance Computing:**
- [Schedule](01_ws_01)

**Workshop II, Data Analysis I:**
- [Schedule](02_ws_01)

**Workshop III, Data Analysis II:**
- [Schedule](03_ws_01)
