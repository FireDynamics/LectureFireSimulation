# CoBra Workshop II

## Data Analysis I

### Preparation
- Please have Python and Jupyter-lab installed, for newcomers the [Anaconda package](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) could be a useful start.
- We will use the [fdsreader package](https://github.com/FireDynamics/fdsreader), which can easily be installed via pip: `pip install fdsreader`, see also the [Tools](../../tools/03_analysis/02_fdsreader) section.

Note: in some cases the user might face issues when installing the Anaconda package, where it can't find a Python interpreter. One option to deal with it is to open the Anaconda Navigator. In the vertical panel on the left, select "Environments". On the next screen, another vertical panel should appear to its right. In it, click on play-symbol of the default Python environment. Another menu appears in which you can select the first item starting a new console. From this console you should be able to start `jupyter-lab`, for example. If JupyterLab does not launch a new window in your browser directly, wait unitl it is completely spooled up and copy the link that is presented near the end of the text into the address line in your browser.
