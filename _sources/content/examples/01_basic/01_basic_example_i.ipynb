It shall provide $\\mf 63~kW$ in a steady-state. The computational domain shall be $\\mf 2.0~m$ tall and have an extent of $\\mf 2.0~m$ in the x and y axis respectively. The fluid cells shall be cube-shaped with an edge length of $\\mf 0.2~m$. The overall simulation time should be $\\mf 60~s$.\n",

In our example case the domain is supposed to be a cube with an edge length of $\\mf 2.0~m$. Let's position it around the origin point in the x- and y-directions and start the z-axis at 0.
