# Team Fire Dynamics

The *Team Fire Dynamics* is a joint team of members of the chair of [Computational Civil Engineering (CCE)](https://cce.uni-wuppertal.de/en.html) at the University of Wuppertal (BUW) and the [Fire Dynamics](https://www.fz-juelich.de/ias/ias-7/EN/Research/Fire_Dynamics/_node.html) division, which is part of the [Institute for Advanced Simulation (IAS-7)](https://www.fz-juelich.de/ias/ias-7) at the [Forschungszentrum J端lich (FZJ)](https://www.fz-juelich.de).

The CCE chair is mainly concerned with the research and development of new computer-based models. The focus of the application here is fire and smoke propagation in buildings. 

In teaching, we focus on computer science and numerics. The main lectures we offer are [Computer Science](https://cce.uni-wuppertal.de/index.php?id=4178&L=0) and [Fire Simulations](https://cce.uni-wuppertal.de/index.php?id=4185&L=0). In addition to this, we regularly offer workshops on *data analysis* and *Raspberry Pi*. 

The simulation models we develop and use are mostly based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In addition, we use genetic optimisation algorithms and image processing methods. What they all have in common is the use of parallel computers, such as the supercomputer [JURECA](https://www.fz-juelich.de/ias/jsc/EN/Expertise/Supercomputers/JURECA/JURECA_node.html) at the [Forschungszentrum J端lich](https://fz-juelich.de/portal/DE/Home/home_node.html).

:::

Our research activities include the use and further development of [FDS](https://pages.nist.gov/fds-smv/) (Fire Dynamics Simulator), which can be used to calculate the spread of smoke and fire in buildings. On the other hand, the development of new simulation tools. These include, for example, the simulation software [ARTSS](https://github.com/FireDynamics/ARTSS) (Accelerator-based Real-Time Smoke Simulator) or [PROPTI](https://github.com/FireDynamics/propti). The research is carried out in close cooperation with the [Fire Dynamics](https://www.fz-juelich.de/ias/ias-7/EN/Research/Fire_Dynamics/_node.html) department at the J端lich Research Centre.
