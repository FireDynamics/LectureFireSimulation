# Overview

## General Information

The lecture *Fire Simulations* at the University of Wuppertal is organised by the chair of [Computational Civil Engineering (CCE)](https://cce.uni-wuppertal.de/). The 2019 founded chair is mainly concerned with the research and development of new computer-based models. The focus of the application is the numerical simulation of fire and smoke propagation in buildings.

This is the first year that we offer this script. The motivation to create this script is on the one hand to give the participants of the lecture a possibility to read the contents. And on the other hand, to make this content freely available to external or former participants.

However, this script is very short and will remain so. Much of the content is already available in greater depth, so that reference is made to the relevant passages - instead of simply copying them.  

As the script is under development, we welcome constructive suggestions and your feedback. This way you can support our whole fire science community.

**For the University of Wuppertal students: All organisational information on the procedure can be found on the [CCE website on the fire simulations lecture](https://cce.uni-wuppertal.de/de/lehre/numerische-brandsimulationen.html).**

## Contents of the Lecture Notes

* It is planned, that this script will not only contain the contents of the lecture *Fire Simulations* but also other contents linked to this lecture, such as *FDS Data Analysis* and *Using High Performance Computers for Fire Simulations*. In the course of the lecture, we will announce the contents relevant for you accordingly.
* The script also contains exercises for all topics, with and without solution paths, but always with a result or the possibility of validating your solution.
* Do not print out the script or save it elsewhere. This way you have the latest version, which is continuously improved and supplemented with content.
* The script will always remain freely accessible.
* The lecture notes and exercises are designed for **FDS version 6.7.5**, and thus may not be valid / reproducible for other versions.
