    "# Energy and Mass Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "This example builds on the \"Steckler compartment\"  {cite}`Steckler.1982` and the `energy_budget` discussion in the (FDS Verification Guide, 7.2.1 The Heat from a Fire). It provides a brief overview over energy and mass transfer in terms of a simulation of a room fire experiment. As an example, the room setup with a door was chosen. The door is located at the centre of the front wall. It is 1.80 m high and 0.60 m wide.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are provided with a pre-built FDS input file ({download}`EnergyMassTransfer.fds`), which needs to be completed and adjusted through the course of this exercise. The geometry of the compartment is based on the Steckler compartment. The fluid cells are cube-shaped with an edge length of 10 cm. Thus, the ceiling height is slightly larger to align with the mesh resolution, i.e. 2.20 m instead of 2.18 m. The top surface of the burner is raised to a height of 0.30 m. It has a squared cross section with an edge length of 0.40 m. In this exercise the burner shall be supplied with propane as fuel (heat of combustion: 46420.0 kJ/kg, soot yield: 20 g/g, CO yield: 10 g/g). "
