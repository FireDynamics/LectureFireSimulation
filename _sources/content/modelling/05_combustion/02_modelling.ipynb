    "A simple combustion modelling approach is the assumption that chemical processes are infinitely fast, the so called mixed-is-burnt model. It is assumed, that the instantaneous thermostatic state is related to a scalar quantity known as mixture fraction $\\mf f =f(\\vec{x},t)$. It is an artificial quantity that describes the mixing of species and varies in space in time. The individual species concentrations are derived from the mixture fraction.\n",
