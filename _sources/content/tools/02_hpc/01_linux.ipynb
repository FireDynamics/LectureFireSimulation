    "DESCRIPTION\n",
    "     The grep utility searches any given input files, selecting lines that match\n",
    "     one or more patterns.  By default, a pattern matches an input line if the\n",
    "     regular expression (RE) in the pattern matches the input line without its\n",
    "     trailing newline.  An empty expression matches every line.  Each input line\n",
    "     that matches at least one of the patterns is written to the standard output.\n",
    "\n",
    "     grep is used for simple patterns and basic regular expressions (BREs); egrep\n",
    "     can handle extended regular expressions (EREs).  See re_format(7) for more\n",
    "     information on regular expressions.  fgrep is quicker than both grep and\n",
    "     egrep, but can only handle fixed patterns (i.e. it does not interpret regu-\n",
    "     lar expressions).  Patterns may consist of one or more lines, allowing any\n",
    "     of the pattern lines to match a portion of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "     zgrep, zegrep, and zfgrep act like grep, egrep, and fgrep, respectively, but\n",
    "     accept input files compressed with the compress(1) or gzip(1) compression\n",
    "     utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "     The following options are available:\n",
    "\n",
    "     -A num, --after-context=num\n",
    "             Print num lines of trailing context after each match.  See also the\n",

    "### Aliases\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The user can personalise their environment in different ways. For example it is possible to define so-called “aliases”. An “alias” allows the user to set up individualised short form commands. For example, a command to call a program with an often used set of parameters could be attached to an alias. Assume we were to use the `ls` command often, together with the parameters to give the long output (`-l`) for all file in a directory (`-a`) in human-readable form (`-h`), i.e. `ls -lah`. We could give it a short form command, for example `lsa`, by typing `alias lsa='ls -lah'` in the command line. However, this definition will only exist as long as the session is active. To make it permanent, it needs to be stored in a script which is loaded when a new session is started. Typically, these definitions are stored in files within the user home directory, specifically the `.bashrc` or better the `.bash_aliases` files. These are simple text files, if they don’t exist they can be easily created. For example using `vim ~/.bash_aliases`. In the `.bashrc` a command needs then to be written to read the `.bash_aliases`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try it out. First we navigate to the users home directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> cd ~\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We set up the temporary alias \"lsa\".\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> alias lsa='ls -lah'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use the alias it should yield the same result as the command itself, try it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now open a new terminal and try to use the alias again. You should see an error message, something like \"`-bash: lsa: command not found`\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To set a permanent alias we are using a file we name `.bash_aliases`. It will be created using Vim again:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> vim ~/.bash_aliases\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the insert mode (`i`) write the following lines into the file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Set aliases.\n",
    "alias lsa='ls -lah'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, hit `Esc` to go back into the normal mode. Type `:w` to save the changes and `:q` to quit Vim, or `:wq` to combine both commands. With `:q!` changes to the file are discarded before closing Vim.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to set up a way to load the `.bash_aliases`. For this we open the `.bashrc` and add the following lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Load aliases.\n",
    "if [-f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then\n",
    "source ~/.bash_aliases\n",
    "fi\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of `source ~/.bash_aliases` also `. ~/.bash_aliases` could be used. If a new terminal is started it will now load the `.bash_aliases`. To load it in the active terminal one can just run the command directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> source ~/.bash_aliases\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful alias is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Check your jobs\n",
    "alias myjobs='squeue -u $USER -o \"%.9i %.22j %.2t %.20S %.12l %.5D %.5C\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When on a computer that uses the SLURM scheduler (see subsection \"SLURM\" in the \"Parallel Execution of FDS\"), it shows all queued jobs of the user (`$USER`)."

    "GitHub is a web hosting service for distributed version control using Git. Git allows collaborative software development, while keeping track of changes to the code. This code can be hosted in open-access repositories via GitHub, like the [FDS repository](https://github.com/firemodels/fds) for example. Operating systems like Linux or MacOS often come with Git integrated and can directly be used from the terminal. Windows users might need to install an application, for example the graphical user interface [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or the lightweight [git for windows](https://gitforwindows.org/). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control systems allow the creation of [branches](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell) to the code base, as well as keeping track of [individual changes](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit). Branches can be used to implement new features, solve bugs or further the development of new software versions, without affecting the stable version. Commits are incremental changes to the code itself. At any given time the user can change the branches and commits to work with specific versions of the software. On the web page of the repository there are a couple of tabs at the top of the page. On the right hand side is the tab “Insights”. Clicking on it and then on the left hand side “Network” gives a brief graphical overview over commits and branches.\n",
    "Typically, the user would clone the repository to their computer, work on the software locally, collect changes into commits and push these changes to the online repository later on. One can also download the repository as a zip archive. \n",
    "\n",
    "To clone a repository, in the terminal navigate to a directory where you would like it to be stored. With Git installed the command `git clone link/to/repo` in the command line will fetch the data from the online repository and clone it to the desired location. The address of the repository can easily be taken from the respective web page. Just click on the green button on the top right labelled “Code”. A dropdown menu opens from which the link to the repo can be copied. \n",
    "With `git checkout branch_label` one can change to a different branch. When only `git checkout` is typed and one hits the Tab-key all available branch labels are shown. Furthermore, individual commits can be loaded by using the commit instead of the branch `git checkout commit_id`. \n"
