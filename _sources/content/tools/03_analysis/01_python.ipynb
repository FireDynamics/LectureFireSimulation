    "\n",
    "### Python Interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python script is a text file, which can be executed in a shell, by invoking \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> python script.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `script.py` is the path to the script. On some systems, there exist multiple versions of Python. To find out which version of Python is used, the `--version` can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "> python --version\n",
    "Python 2.7.16\n",
    "\n",
    "> python3 --version\n",
    "Python 3.8.9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the version 3 of Python needs to be explicitly stated. In general, version 2 of Python should not be used anymore, yet there may exist OS components, which rely on verion 2, thus it is still always available.\n",

    "### Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we will use [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) as an interactive Python editor. Jupyter notebooks allow to work with so called cells. They may be either Python code, that can be executed cell-wise, or markdown text, to include descriptive information to the script. In contrast to Jupyter, JupyterLab provides a new flexible interface for working with Jupyter notebooks.\n",

    "JupyterLab \n",
    "\n",

    "### Syntax\n",

    "The syntax of Python is very simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "* tokens (variables, operators, etc.) can be separated by multiple spaces, but indentation matters\n",
    "* one expression per line\n",
    "* code blocks, e.g. the body of a loop, are indicated by indentation\n",
    "* there are only a few reserved keywords, e.g. `if`, `for`, `in`, `import`, etc.\n",
    "* line content after a `#` is interpreted as a comment and thus ignored during execution\n",
    "\n",
    "Indentation example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i=5 \n",
    "b=i*3\n",

    "    if it < 5:\n",
    "        print(\"too small\") \n",
    "        do_something(it)\n",
    "        b = b + it**2\n",
    "print(b)\n",
