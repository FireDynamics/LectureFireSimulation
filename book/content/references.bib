abstract = {{In this Letter, we demonstrate a 5 kHz 1D Raman instrument for temporally and spatially resolved quantitative measurements of temperature and all the major species (N2, O2, H2, and H2O) concentration in H2-air flames. The major constituents of the system are a pulse-burst laser operated at 5 kHz and four back-illuminated CCD cameras operated in subframe burst-gating mode. The use of CCD cameras allows achieving a high sampling rate with no compromise on instrument precision, but it requires one camera for each species of interest. A cascade of dichroic mirrors and bandpass filters spectrally separates the Raman signal associated with each of the four species and directs it to a separate camera. Measurements in a well-characterized H2-air premixed flat flame show that the system has precision comparable with the low-speed Raman system. The measuring uncertainty of the species mole fraction ranges between 1\% (N2) and 3∼4\% (O2 in lean flames). Measurements in laminar and turbulent H2/N2 jet flames show good agreement with the theoretical prediction. By measuring all species simultaneously, important combustion quantities such as the mixture fraction are also derived.}},

abstract = {{Fifty-five full-scale steady-state experiments were conducted to study the flow induced by a simulated pool fire in a compartment under conditions characteristic of the developing fire period. The mass flow rate through the door or window opening and bounds on the fire plume entrainment rate are presented as a function of opening geometry, fire strength, and fire location.The characteristics of the measured opening flow rates are explained by a simple hydrostatic model based on temperature distribution. A good correlation between the measured results and the idealized flows, taking into account the complete temperature distribution, is demonstrated.Entrainment results for fires near walls are in reasonable agreement with results from free-standing plume models. Except for the smallest openings, fires in other locations entrain at a rate two to three times the rate predicted by these models. This phenomenon is attributed to room disturbances caused by the opening flow and is similar to the behavior of a fire plume in a cross wind.}},
