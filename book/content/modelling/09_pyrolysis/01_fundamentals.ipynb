    "As stated in section 1.1, pyrolysis describes the emission of gases out of the solid material. It is the thermal decomposition of materials by heat under inert atmosphere. Whereby thermal decomposition is defined as a process of extesive chemical species change caused by heat. The gases released from the solid may afterwards react with oxygen, this reaction is not part of the pyrolysis. \n",

    "## Studying pyrolysis with the TGA\n",
    "\n",
    "A thermogravimetric analyser (TGA) is often used to study pyrolysis. In a tga the mass of the sample is so small (usually between 5 to 10 mg) that it is assumed that heat and mass transfer can be neglected. A picture of a tga device can be seen in  {numref}`fig-pyrolysis-TGA`.\n",

    "In a TGA a small amount of sample mass is placed in a crucible. This crucible is placed in the TGA. During the measurement the device will be heated up with a specified heating rate (e.g. 5K/min), while the mass loss of the sample is measured. This can be done under different atmosphere, typically experiments are ran either under inert atmosphere (e.g. nitrogen or Argon) or under synthetic air. The measurement will give the massloss as function of time. This can be used to determine the massloss rate as function of temperature, which can be used to determine the kinetic parameters of the material. \n",
