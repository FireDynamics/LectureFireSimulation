    "The process of determining that the implementation of a calculation method accurately represents the developer’s conceptual description of the calculation method and the solution to the calculation method. It does not imply that the governing equations are appropriate; only that the equations are being solved correctly.\n",

    "## Validation\n",
    "The process of determining the degree to which a calculation method is an accurate representation of the real world from the perspective of the intended uses of the calculation method. It typically involves comparing model results with experimental measurement. Differences that cannot be explained in terms of numerical errors in the model or uncertainty in the measurements are attributed to the assumptions and simplifications of the physical model.\n",

In addition to illustrating the comparability of models in actual end-use conditions, this will test the ability of those who use the model to develop appropriate input data for the models.\n",

Deficiencies in available input (used for the blind calculation) should become most apparent with comparison of the open and blind calculation."
