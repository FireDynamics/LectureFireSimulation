    "DESCRIPTION\n",
    "     The grep utility searches any given input files, selecting lines that match\n",
    "     one or more patterns.  By default, a pattern matches an input line if the\n",
    "     regular expression (RE) in the pattern matches the input line without its\n",
    "     trailing newline.  An empty expression matches every line.  Each input line\n",
    "     that matches at least one of the patterns is written to the standard output.\n",
    "\n",
    "     grep is used for simple patterns and basic regular expressions (BREs); egrep\n",
    "     can handle extended regular expressions (EREs).  See re_format(7) for more\n",
    "     information on regular expressions.  fgrep is quicker than both grep and\n",
    "     egrep, but can only handle fixed patterns (i.e. it does not interpret regu-\n",
    "     lar expressions).  Patterns may consist of one or more lines, allowing any\n",
    "     of the pattern lines to match a portion of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "     zgrep, zegrep, and zfgrep act like grep, egrep, and fgrep, respectively, but\n",
    "     accept input files compressed with the compress(1) or gzip(1) compression\n",
    "     utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "     The following options are available:\n",
    "\n",
    "     -A num, --after-context=num\n",
    "             Print num lines of trailing context after each match.  See also the\n",

    "\n",
    "     -a, --text\n",
    "             Treat all files as ASCII text.  Normally grep will simply print\n",
    "             ``Binary file ... matches'' if files contain binary characters.  Use\n",
    "             of this option forces grep to output lines matching the specified\n",

    "     -b, --byte-offset\n",

First, the shell will evaluate the pattern and search for matching paths. Then it will expand the wildcard pattern with the explicit list of the results, which typically is passed to an applicaiton.\n",
